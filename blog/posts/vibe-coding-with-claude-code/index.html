                <p><strong>What I Built:</strong></p>

                <ul>
                    <li><a href="https://github.com/yizhouyu/youtube-manager" target="_blank"><strong>YouTube
                                Manager</strong></a> — AI-powered SEO tool with web UI (54 commits)</li>
                    <li><strong>My personal page</strong> (<a href="https://yizhouyu.dev"
                            target="_blank">https://yizhouyu.dev</a>) — Personal site that sat empty since 2017 (45
                        commits)</li>

                        events (38 commits)</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>137 commits. Zero lines of code written by hand.</strong></p>

                <p>I wrote this post with Claude Code as well — I gave it the GitHub repos to research commit history,
                    then let it edit its draft via voice dictation.</p>

                <h2>TL;DR - Key Takeaways</h2>

                <p>If you're skimming, here's what matters:</p>

                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Research overhead → zero</strong>: No more "learn framework X before building Y." Just
                        ask Claude Code.</li>
                    <li><strong>The SWE skill that matters most</strong>: Knowing which questions to ask (concurrency,
                        error handling), not writing syntax.</li>
                    <li><strong>Claude helps with non-coding tasks too</strong>: Domain purchasing recommendations
                        (suggested Cloudflare), DNS configuration, deployment setup—all the operational stuff that
                        usually requires separate research.</li>
                    <li><strong>Vibe coding ≠ production engineering</strong>: No code review/RFC/oncall concerns = 80%
                        less friction. This unlocks a different kind of velocity.</li>
                    <li><strong>Voice + async = game changer</strong>: Dictate features instead of typing → come back →
                        Claude built it.</li>
                    <li><strong>Multitasking across projects</strong>: Ran three separate VS Code windows with Claude
                        Code instances simultaneously.</li>
                    <li><strong>$100/month Claude Max is worth it</strong> if you have side project ideas that never
                        materialize due to execution barriers.</li>
                    <li><strong>The skill gap is narrowing but not closing</strong>: Non-engineers can build functional
                        apps now. Building robust/secure/scalable systems still requires engineering judgment.</li>
                    <li><strong>These are personal consumption tools</strong>: Not production-ready apps yet. Building
                        for production with Claude Code is the next frontier to explore.</li>
                </ol>

                <h2>Why This Matters: The Conversation That Started It All</h2>

                <p>I'm an amateur YouTube creator on the side (travel vlog in Chinese). For years, I've known SEO
                    matters—optimized titles, descriptions, tags—but I just didn't care enough to invest the time.
                    Writing good SEO metadata involves a fair amount of effort. So I... didn't do it.</p>

                <p>Last Friday: Conversation with my teammate Gary. He recommended I actually do some SEO for my
                    videos.<br>
                    Saturday morning: "Okay, let me put Claude Code to the test."<br>
                    This wasn't some grand plan. It was: "Can this thing actually solve a real problem I have?"<br>
                    Spoiler: Yes. And then I got carried away and built two more things.</p>

                <h2>The Projects: How They Actually Evolved</h2>

                <h3>YouTube Manager: From Script to Full Application</h3>

                <p><strong>Saturday morning - The First Task:</strong><br>
                    "Write me a script to replace all my previous videos' titles and descriptions with SEO-enhanced
                    versions. Generate suggestions and let me review before applying."<br>
                    This was the test. Can Claude Code actually understand:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>YouTube API authentication</li>
                    <li>Fetching all my videos</li>
                    <li>Generating bilingual SEO metadata (Chinese primary, English secondary)</li>
                    <li>Side-by-side comparison UI</li>
                    <li>Manual review workflow</li>
                </ul>

                <p>90 minutes later: fully working CLI tool. OAuth2 authentication, batch processing, beautiful
                    side-by-side diffs using Rich tables, API rate limiting, video tracking to prevent reprocessing.<br>
                    I tested it. It worked. The metadata suggestions were actually good.</p>

                <p><strong>Saturday afternoon - The Natural Progression:</strong><br>
                    "Okay, this works. But I want a web UI for this."<br>
                    At this point I trusted Claude Code enough to expand scope. The progression felt natural:</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>Prove the core concept (SEO script) ✓</li>
                    <li>Build a better interface (web UI)</li>
                    <li>Add complementary features (analytics, thumbnails, upload workflow)</li>
                </ol>

                <p>By Sunday: full-stack Flask app with analytics dashboard, smart upload workflow, AI-powered thumbnail
                    generation, real-time progress tracking.</p>

                <img src="./images/youtube-manager-1-select-files.png"
                    alt="YouTube Manager Step 1 - Select files for upload with smart file picker">

                    alt="YouTube Manager Step 3 - Review metadata and upload to YouTube">

                <p><strong>This organic evolution is important.</strong> I didn't plan to build a full web app. I
                    started with the minimum viable thing (a script), validated it worked, then kept going because the
                    friction was so low.</p>

                <h3>Personal Website: The 8-Year Procrastination</h3>

                <p><strong>Background:</strong> Created <code>yizhouyu.github.io</code> on August 1, 2017. Last commit:
                    August 1, 2017 @ 2:41 PM. It sat empty because learning HTML/CSS felt like a chore.</p>

                <p><strong>Saturday 10:03 PM:</strong> "Claude, build me a personal website."<br>
                    <strong>What shipped:</strong> Modern responsive site with experience timeline, contact form,
                    analytics, light/dark mode, custom domain setup.
                </p>

                <p><strong>Then the non-coding help:</strong> "How do I get a custom domain?"<br>
                    This is where Claude Code showed its versatility beyond just writing code. It didn't just say "go
                    buy a domain"—it walked me through the entire process:</p>

                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Before I even bought:</strong> Suggested where to buy the domain. Recommended Cloudflare
                        as registrar (better pricing, integrated DNS management).</li>
                    <li><strong>After purchase:</strong> Step-by-step DNS configuration instructions specific to GitHub
                        Pages.</li>
                    <li><strong>SSL setup:</strong> Explained how GitHub handles certificates automatically.</li>
                    <li><strong>Verification:</strong> How to confirm everything's working correctly.</li>
                </ol>

                <p>20 minutes later: live at <a href="https://yizhouyu.dev" target="_blank">yizhouyu.dev</a> (and <a
                        href="https://yzyzy.dev" target="_blank">yzyzy.dev</a> since I bought 2 domains).</p>

                <img src="./images/personal-website.png"
                    alt="Personal website at yizhouyu.dev - Modern responsive design with experience timeline and dark mode support">

                <p><strong>The insight:</strong> Claude Code isn't just a coding tool—it's a full stack development
                    partner. It handles the operational stuff (domain registration, DNS, deployment) that usually
                    requires separate Google searches and documentation reading.</p>

                <p>BTW my 2 domains cost $12 each per year. They would've cost a lot more if I wanted to use .io or .ai.
                </p>

                <h3>Life in Weeks: More Than Just a Fork</h3>

                <p>Ran Ding (former colleague) has this beautiful <a href="https://rd.me/weeks" target="_blank">Life in
                        Weeks visualization</a> and open-sourced the code. I didn't just fork it—I wanted to customize
                    it heavily with my own data and features.</p>

                <p><strong>The Challenge:</strong><br>
                    My travel data lives in Notion (5-6 trips per year since 2022). I could manually copy it... or I
                    could ask Claude to set up a Notion MCP server to import it automatically.<br>
                    <strong>Sunday 11:51 PM:</strong> "Can you set up a Notion MCP server to import my travel data?"<br>
                    I'd never used MCP. Didn't know how it worked.<br>
                    Claude: searched Notion MCP docs → explained auth flow → wrote integration → imported all events.
                    Zero guidance from me beyond the initial ask.
                </p>

                <p><strong>Also: Major Customizations</strong><br>
                    This wasn't a simple fork-and-deploy. I added significant new features:</p>

                <p><strong>Event Category Filtering:</strong></p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Grouped timeline events into categories: Personal, Education, Career, Travel, World Events</li>
                    <li>Built interactive filter UI with chip-style toggles</li>
                    <li>Users can show/hide entire categories to focus on what matters to them</li>
                    <li>Example: Toggle off "World Events" to see just your personal timeline</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Enhanced UX:</strong></p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Rich tooltips showing month/year on hover for any week cell</li>
                    <li>Clickable links auto-detected in event descriptions</li>
                    <li>Improved tooltip positioning and display in compact mode</li>
                    <li>Added custom "YY" favicon matching my main site branding</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Deployment & Infrastructure:</strong></p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Deployed to Vercel (Claude's suggestion—I'd never used Vercel before)</li>
                    <li>Set up Cloudflare Worker proxy for clean URL routing (<a href="https://yizhouyu.dev/weeks"
                            target="_blank">yizhouyu.dev/weeks</a>)</li>
                    <li>Configured environment variables for privacy-protected dates</li>
                </ul>

                <p>The result: <a href="https://yizhouyu.dev/weeks" target="_blank">yizhouyu.dev/weeks</a></p>

                <p><strong>Key learning:</strong> MCP + Web Search = autonomous problem solving. Claude wasn't executing
                    my plan—it was researching, planning, and executing on its own. I was treating Claude as the
                    developer and myself as the user, just with enough technical background to ask clarifying questions.
                </p>

                <h2>What Makes This Different: Key Insights</h2>

                <h3>1. Claude Code Handles More Than Just Code</h3>

                <p>This weekend showed me that Claude Code's value extends far beyond writing code:</p>

                <p><strong>Coding:</strong></p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Wrote Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS</li>
                    <li>Set up Flask app structure</li>
                    <li>Integrated YouTube API, Claude API, Notion API</li>
                    <li>Implemented OAuth2 flows</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Infrastructure & Operations:</strong></p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Recommended Cloudflare for domain registration</li>
                    <li>Provided DNS configuration instructions</li>
                    <li>Explained GitHub Pages deployment</li>
                    <li>Set up Vercel deployment with custom routing</li>
                    <li>Configured Cloudflare Workers for URL proxying</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Architecture & Design Decisions:</strong></p>

                <ul>
                    <li>"Should this be Flask or static site?" → discussed tradeoffs</li>
                    <li>"How should we handle API rate limits?" → implemented backoff strategy</li>
                    <li>"Where should API keys live?" → explained server-side env variables</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Research & Documentation:</strong></p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Found Notion MCP documentation via web search</li>
                    <li>Researched OAuth2 best practices</li>
                    <li>Looked up YouTube API quota limits</li>
                </ul>

                <p>In traditional development, each of these areas would require separate research, different tools,
                    context switching. With Claude Code, it's all in one conversation.</p>

                <p><strong>This is the real productivity unlock:</strong> Not just faster coding, but eliminating the
                    overhead of figuring out everything else.</p>

                <h3>2. Multitasking Across Projects Actually Works</h3>

                <p>Here's something that surprised me: <strong>I ran three VS Code windows with separate Claude Code
                        instances simultaneously.</strong></p>

                <p>Saturday night workflow:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Window 1:</strong> YouTube Manager web UI development</li>
                    <li><strong>Window 2:</strong> Personal website customization</li>
                    <li><strong>Window 3:</strong> Life in Weeks customization</li>
                </ul>

                <p>I'd give instructions to one window, switch to another while it worked, come back to review. Natural
                    context switching between projects.</p>

                <p><strong>This is a fundamentally different development experience.</strong> Normally, context
                    switching between projects is expensive—you lose momentum, forget where you were, need to rebuild
                    mental models.</p>

                <p>With Claude Code, each instance maintains its own context. I could work on whichever project felt
                    interesting in the moment. Low friction, high velocity.</p>

                <p><strong>Important caveat:</strong> There are probably many hidden features and best practices I
                    haven't discovered yet. This weekend was my first real usage. I'm incentivized to learn more—the
                    initial experience was compelling enough that I want to get better at using the tool.</p>

                <h3>3. Research Overhead Goes to Zero</h3>

                <p><strong>Traditional workflow for building a website:</strong></p>

                <ol>
                    <li>Research frameworks (Next.js? Astro? SvelteKit?)</li>
                    <li>Learn chosen framework</li>
                    <li>Research CSS solutions (Tailwind? Styled-components?)</li>
                    <li>Learn deployment platforms (Vercel? Netlify? GitHub Pages?)</li>
                    <li>Figure out DNS configuration</li>
                    <li>Actually build the thing</li>
                </ol>

                <p>Steps 1-5 can take <strong>days</strong>.</p>

                <p><strong>With Claude Code:</strong> "Build me a website."<br>
                    Claude picks the stack, writes the code, explains deployment. Research phase:
                    <strong>eliminated</strong>.
                </p>

                <p>The UI matters too: everything in one interface. No context switching between docs, Stack Overflow,
                    terminal, editor. Just conversation → code → deployed.</p>

                <h3>4. Vibe Coding ≠ Production Engineering (And That's the Point)</h3>

                <p>At work, code is heavily scrutinized:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Detailed diff summaries (why, not just what)</li>
                    <li>Comprehensive test plans</li>
                    <li>Code review feedback loops</li>
                    <li>Oncall concerns and reliability standards</li>
                    <li>Team conventions and style guides</li>
                </ul>

                <p>This is <strong>necessary for production systems at scale.</strong> But it means <strong>most time
                        isn't spent coding—it's spent on meta-work around coding.</strong></p>

                <p><strong>Vibe coding with Claude removes all of that:</strong></p>

                <ul>
                    <li>No code review</li>
                    <li>No RFC process</li>
                    <li>No explaining decisions to anyone</li>
                    <li>No production reliability concerns</li>
                    <li>Code for personal consumption only</li>
                </ul>

                <p>This eliminates ~80% of the friction. What remains is pure building. <strong>137 commits in 48
                        hours</strong>—impossible in normal work contexts.</p>

                <p><strong>Important distinction:</strong> All three projects are for <strong>personal
                        consumption</strong>. I haven't built anything production-ready with Claude Code yet—that's
                    something to explore in the future. The stakes are low, which is why this velocity is possible.</p>

                <h3>5. The SWE Skill That Still Matters: Knowing Which Questions to Ask</h3>

                <p>Claude Code didn't make engineering background irrelevant—it changed how it's valuable.</p>

                <p><strong>My role this weekend:</strong> I treated Claude as the developer and myself as the user. The
                    difference is I had enough technical background to ask clarifying questions when needed.</p>

                <p><strong>Examples from this weekend:</strong></p>

                <table>
                    <thead>
                        <tr>
                            <th>Question</th>
                            <th>Why It Mattered</th>
                        </tr>
                    </thead>
                    <tbody>
                        <tr>
                            <td>"Are these API calls parallel or sequential?"</td>
                            <td>Identified performance bottleneck → 70% latency reduction</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>"What happens if YouTube API times out during upload?"</td>
                            <td>Added retry logic before it became a problem</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>"Are we exposing API keys in the client bundle?"</td>
                            <td>Security catch before shipping</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>"Should this be a Flask app or a static site?"</td>
                            <td>Architecture decision based on API endpoint needs</td>
                        </tr>
                    </tbody>
                </table>

                <p>The skill that mattered most wasn't coding—it was <strong>knowing which questions to ask</strong>.
                    Understanding how components interact, where bottlenecks happen, what failure modes exist.</p>

                <p>Junior engineers can absolutely use Claude Code productively. But experience helps guide it toward
                    robust solutions faster.</p>

                <h3>6. Voice Dictation + Async = The Killer Combo</h3>

                <p>I use <a href="https://superwhisper.com" target="_blank">SuperWhisper</a> for AI dictation. Pairing
                    it with Claude Code unlocks a different workflow:</p>

                <p><strong>dictate feature requests → come back → Claude built it</strong></p>

                <p>This entire post was drafted via dictation as well.</p>

                <p>The magic is <strong>async + voice</strong>. Describe what you want while doing something else.
                    Claude works while you're away. Review when you're back.</p>

                <p>Maximally efficient use of time.</p>

                <h3>7. The Subscription Economics Actually Make Sense</h3>

                <p><strong>Claude Pro ($20/month):</strong> Light usage. Hit limits quickly if building.<br>
                    <strong>Claude Max ($100/month):</strong> 5x capacity. I hit limits twice over the weekend (resets
                    every 5 hours).
                </p>

                <p><strong>Is $100/month worth it?</strong><br>
                    Before this weekend: no, I never thought I would pay $100.<br>
                    After this weekend: <strong>absolutely yes.</strong></p>

                <p>Claude Code feels <strong>purpose-built for shipping</strong>. $100 pays for itself if it results in
                    even one project you wouldn't have built otherwise.</p>

                <p><strong>Advice:</strong> Start with Pro ($20). Hit limits within a day? Upgrade. You'll know.</p>

                <h3>8. The Skill Gap Is Narrowing, Not Closing</h3>

                <p><strong>What changed:</strong> Non-engineers can now build functional apps with Claude Code. Huge for
                    PMs, designers, others with ideas but no implementation skills.</p>

                <p><strong>What didn't change:</strong> Building something functional ≠ building something robust,
                    secure, scalable, maintainable. Those concerns still require engineering judgment.</p>

                <p><strong>The higher-order skills matter more:</strong></p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Knowing which questions to ask</li>
                    <li>Understanding system architecture</li>
                    <li>Recognizing performance bottlenecks</li>
                    <li>Anticipating failure modes</li>
                    <li>Making technical trade-off decisions</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Claude Code is a <strong>force multiplier</strong> for people who have these skills. It's an enabler
                    for people who don't. Both outcomes are good.</p>

                <h2>Limitations and Trade-offs</h2>

                <p><strong>This only worked because:</strong></p>

                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Personal projects = low stakes.</strong> No code review means bugs ship. Fine for side
                        projects. Not fine at work.</li>
                    <li><strong>I'm the only user.</strong> No need for edge case handling, scale optimization, or
                        security beyond basics.</li>
                    <li><strong>These are personal consumption tools, not production apps.</strong> I haven't built
                        anything production-ready with Claude Code yet. That's the next frontier—understanding how it
                        works for systems that require high reliability, security, and scale.</li>
                    <li><strong>The domains were well-trodden.</strong> Claude assembled known patterns (Flask +
                        Tailwind, Next.js + Vercel, OAuth2 flows), not inventing new algorithms.</li>
                </ol>

                <p><strong>Would I use this for production code at work?</strong> I'm excited to try Claude Code
                    internally for prototyping and exploration.</p>

                <p><strong>Is this "real" development work?</strong> I didn't write syntax, but I:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Made technical decisions</li>
                    <li>Debugged issues</li>
                    <li>Reviewed generated code</li>
                    <li>Guided implementation with questions</li>
                </ul>

                <p>The output is code that works. The process just looks different.</p>

                <h2>What's Next: Future Exploration</h2>

                <p><strong>Things I want to try:</strong></p>

                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Building a production-ready app with Claude Code</strong>: Understanding how it handles
                        requirements for reliability, security, scale, monitoring, error handling at production level.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Learning hidden features</strong>: This weekend was my first real usage. There are
                        definitely features, workflows, and best practices I haven't discovered yet.</li>
                    <li><strong>Teaching others</strong>: Now that I've seen what's possible, I want to help teammates
                        explore what they can build.</li>
                </ol>

                <h2>Should You Try This?</h2>

                <p><strong>If you've been sitting on side project ideas, the barrier is effectively zero now.</strong>
                </p>

                <p>The repos are public—check the commits to see the velocity:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>YouTube Manager:</strong> <a href="https://github.com/yizhouyu/youtube-manager"
                            target="_blank">github.com/yizhouyu/youtube-manager</a></li>
                    <li><strong>Personal Website:</strong> <a href="https://github.com/yizhouyu/yizhouyu.github.io"
                            target="_blank">github.com/yizhouyu/yizhouyu.github.io</a></li>
                    <li><strong>Life in Weeks:</strong> <a href="https://github.com/yizhouyu/life-in-weeks-nextjs"
                            target="_blank">github.com/yizhouyu/life-in-weeks-nextjs</a></li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Start with the $20 Claude Pro plan.</strong> Build something small. See if you hit limits.
                    Upgrade if needed.</p>

                <p><strong>The bottleneck isn't the tool anymore. It's whether you have something you want to
                        build.</strong></p>

                <hr>

                <p><strong>P.S.</strong> I haven't tried OpenAI's Codex or Cursor yet, so I can't compare. If anyone has
                    experience with both, I'd love to hear how they stack up.</p>
